Hi all,

So in order to prep for the actual class in a few weeks, understanding of the basis material of the 
subject is essential to understanding how it works in the long run. Therefore, in order to get a 
better understanding of all the components of the class, I recommend looking through Chapter 1 and
answering the questions in the back of the chapter, just the multiple choice, not the labs or case
studies or anything else. To turn it in, commit a file titled FirstName_3_Chapter1.txt. I find it's
easiest to do this over the GitHub webpage instead of through the terminal, but I don't really care.
Have fun!
